## 1. Executive Summary

This document certifies that the **School Admission System** has undergone comprehensive end-to-end regression testing, cross-student journey audits in a real browser, high-concurrency race condition testing, and containerized deployment verification. 

Every single functional, technical, UX, and concurrency requirement from the original five-page assignment specification (`Asst_Software_Engineer_Project_Assignment.pdf`) has been verified and passed with zero regressions.

---

## 2. Complete Real Browser Student Journey Audits

Automated end-to-end browser audits were executed against the live application using Headless Google Chrome via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (`verify_phase6_regression.py`).

### 2.1 Workflow 1: Student A Complete Admission Journey
- **Student Identifier:** `20152690000000001` (17-digit BRN).
- **Initial Context:** Fresh browser session without cached credentials.
- **Verification Observations:**
  1. Top-of-page BRN input (`#top-brn-input`) started completely empty and enabled; `localStorage` was null.
  2. Entering Student A's 17-digit BRN enabled the **Submit ID** button (`Ready` badge, without premature auto-saving); clicking **Submit ID** locked the input (`disabled` with `Lock` icon & green `Active` badge).
  3. Network monitoring confirmed outgoing API requests carried header: `X-Student-Id: ...`.
  4. Class action buttons dynamically switched from *"Enter BRN Above to Apply"* to active state *"Apply for Admission"*.
  5. Applied for *"Class 6 - Day Shift"*: seat hold was acquired instantly via `POST /classes/{id}/holds` (`201 Created`).
  6. The `ActiveHoldCard` section rendered immediately with a live 10-minute countdown timer (`09:59`), class details, hold ID, and *"Pay Admission Fee (Confirm)"* button.
  7. Confirmed simulated payment: `POST /holds/{id}/confirm` transitioned hold status to `CONFIRMED`.
  8. UI updated to show *"Admission Confirmed Successfully!"* banner with emerald styling.
- **Evidence:** `e2e_evidence/p6_1_student_a_confirmed.png`
- **Result:** **PASS**

---

### 2.2 Workflow 2: Student B Isolation & Independent Application
- **Student Identifier:** `20152690000000002` (17-digit BRN).
- **Switching Action:** Clicked *"Switch Student"* button adjacent to header input; confirmed in the accessible modal.
- **Verification Observations:**
  1. Student A's active session, confirmed admission banner, and cached hold cards immediately disappeared from the UI.
  2. Client-side `localStorage` was deleted and TanStack Query cache was purged (`queryClient.clear()`).
  3. Entered Student B's identifier in `#top-brn-input` and clicked **Submit ID** (locking `#top-brn-input` cleanly).
  4. Outgoing requests were intercepted and confirmed to use `X-Student-Id: 20152690000000002`.
  5. Student B saw clean class listings and could not view any of Student A's application history or confirmed admission.
  6. Student B applied for *"Class 6 - Morning Shift"*: hold was created independently (`201 Created`).
  7. Active hold card rendered for Student B in Morning Shift with their own independent countdown timer.
- **Evidence:** `e2e_evidence/p6_2_student_b_applied.png`
- **Result:** **PASS**

---

### 2.3 Workflow 3: Active Hold Server-Side Preservation
- **Test Objective:** Prove that switching students on the client does NOT cancel or drop active holds in PostgreSQL.
- **Test Students:** Student C (`20152690000000003`) $\to$ Student D (`20152690000000004`) $\to$ back to Student C.
- **Verification Observations:**
  1. Student C applied for *"Class 6 - Day Shift"*; active hold was created on PostgreSQL with status `HELD`.
  2. Switched identity to Student D in the browser.
  3. Querying PostgreSQL directly confirmed:
     ```sql
     SELECT "Status" FROM "Holds" WHERE "StudentId" = '20152690000000003';
     -- Returned: HELD (untouched, neither cancelled nor deleted)
     ```
  4. Switched browser identity back to Student C (`20152690000000003`).
  5. The UI automatically restored Student C's active hold in *"Class 6 - Day Shift"* along with the active countdown timer.
- **Evidence:** `e2e_evidence/p6_3_student_c_hold_preserved.png`
- **Result:** **PASS**

---

### 2.4 Workflow 4: Hold Expiration & Reapplication
- **Student Identifier:** Student E (`20152690000000005`).
- **Test Objective:** Verify that an expired hold automatically releases the seat, updates the UI without page reload, disables payment, and permits the student to re-apply.
- **Verification Observations:**
  1. Student E created a hold in *"Class 6 - Day Shift"*.
  2. Hold expiration timestamp was updated in PostgreSQL to `NOW() + INTERVAL '3 SECONDS'`.
  3. At $t = 3$s, the live countdown timer reached `00:00`.
  4. Without reloading the page:
     - `CountdownTimer` displayed `00:00 Expired`.
     - `handleExpire()` triggered automated query invalidation.
     - `ActiveHoldCard` updated to display *"Hold Period Has Expired. The seat has been released for other students."*
     - Payment confirmation action became unmounted / disabled.
     - Class card action button automatically updated from *"Application Already Active"* to active *"Apply Again"*.
  5. Clicked *"Apply Again"*: a brand new hold was successfully created for Student E with a fresh 10-minute timer.
- **Evidence:** `e2e_evidence/p6_4_expired_and_reapply.png`
- **Result:** **PASS**

---

## 3. Concurrency Safety & Invariant Verification

The system enforces strict multi-process concurrency safety at the PostgreSQL database engine level:

1. **Class-Level Seat Cap Serialization:**
   - Every hold request executes inside a database transaction:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM "Classes" WHERE "Id" = @id FOR UPDATE;
     ```
   - All concurrent requests for the same class are serialized. Over-allocation is mathematically prohibited:
     $$\text{HeldSeats} + \text{ConfirmedSeats} \le \text{TotalSeats}$$
2. **Cross-Class Simultaneous Hold Advisory Lock:**
   - When a student concurrently fires requests across different classes, class row-level locks do not serialize the student check.
   - The system acquires a transaction-scoped PostgreSQL advisory lock on the student identifier:
     ```sql
     SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(@studentId));
     ```
   - Proved in `SameStudent_SimultaneousHoldRequestsAcrossDifferentClasses_ExactlyOneSucceeds`: exactly one request succeeds (`201 Created`), while the second sees the active hold and returns `409 Conflict`.
3. **100-Request Concurrency Stress Test:**
   - Test: `ConcurrentHoldRequests_ShouldNeverOverAllocateSeats`
   - Setup: 10 total seats, 100 simultaneous concurrent HTTP requests.
   - Outcome: Exactly 10 created, 90 rejected (`409 Conflict`), **0 over-allocated**.

## 8. Remaining Limitations & Architectural Scope Notes

1. **Authentication:**
   - Per the explicit assignment specification (*"Login লাগবে না। Page-এর উপরে একটা ঘরে শিক্ষার্থীর জন্ম নিবন্ধন নম্বর লেখা যাবে। UI এটাকেই শিক্ষার্থীর পরিচয় হিসেবে ধরে নেবে। API-তে শিক্ষার্থীর পরিচয় আসবে X-Student-Id header দিয়ে।"*), the application does not implement password hashing, JWT sessions, or OAuth. The BRN serves as the client tracking identifier.
2. **Simulated Payment Gateway:**
   - The payment flow is simulated via `POST /holds/{id}/confirm` without calling an external banking provider (e.g., bKash, SSLCommerz), strictly as instructed by the assignment.

## 9. Final Release & Delivery Status

All tests, browser regressions, concurrency guarantees, and documentation checks have completed with **100% SUCCESS**.

The repository has been successfully pushed to the configured GitHub remote (`origin/main`) with verified commit authorship, complete requirement traceability, and comprehensive visual evidence.
